# **chcp**
This library provides native bindings for Windows APIs. To start with, `SetConsoleOutputCP` and `GetConsoleOutputCP` APIs.

### **Use Case**
While the most essential and common system APIs are abstracted well inside Node.js core, applications dealing with non-web transactions often find many win32 APIs are not included in the core. This imposes problem for a small subset of the users. 

`chcp` is an effort to encapsulate the output code page used by the console of the running process.

If you wish to contribute by adding more APIs that are useful for common workload, welcome! Please start by opening an issue to discuss first.
